A) Component Lifecycle in React Functional Components
In React functional components, lifecycle behavior is handled using the useEffect hook:
- Mount Phase :
When the component first loads, useEffect(() => {...}, []) runs once.
Example: fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or initializing values.
- Update Phase :
When state or props change, useEffect(() => {...}, [dependencies]) runs again.
Example: reacting to changes in count, updating the DOM, or recalculating values.
- Unmount Phase :
When the component is removed from the DOM, React runs the cleanup function inside useEffect.
Example: useEffect(() => { return () => {...}; }, []) cleans up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners.



B) Cleanup Function: What & Why
- What is it?
A cleanup function is the return () => {...} inside useEffect. It defines what should happen when the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs.
- Why is it needed?
- Prevents memory leaks (e.g., dangling event listeners or timers).
- Ensures resources like subscriptions, sockets, or intervals are properly released.
- Keeps the app efficient and avoids unexpected behavior when components mount/unmount repeatedly.
